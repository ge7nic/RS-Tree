# RS-Tree
RS-Tree Project to show off usability of Red-Black-Trees.

## How to run
Just clone and run ```mvn javafx:run```. An installed JDK is neccessary, it should run on Java8 and up.

Alternativly you can run the .msi-installer in the Executables folder. The resulting .exe will run on it's own without any preinstalled version of Java.
